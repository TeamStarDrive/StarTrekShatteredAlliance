Hello everyone I fix the wireframe and button, and got it work in game nicely.
Just follow the installation and have fun. My previous version I discovered was taken from a 
project made by Major Payne, he supplied me with the button and wireframe. Also, let me release this new final version.
I got this to only work on fresh version of Armada 2, no other mods install.

Installation:

SOD files goes directly into the SOD folder.

TGA files goes into the Textures/RGB folder. (Hint: open the texture folder the RGB folder is in there)

chutet.ODF file goes into the ODF/Ships folder. (Same as above)

tech1.TT file goes directly into the techtree folder. 

cyard2.ODF file goes into the ODF/Stations. (Hope you got in down by now.)

gui_global.spr file goes directly into the Sprites folder.

Run game and test it out.

Special Thanks

To Major Payne for makes this mod. I can't take the credit for make the ship model or coding. Only for fixing the small coding errors.
Which were the weapon files being used in the ship odf file.
