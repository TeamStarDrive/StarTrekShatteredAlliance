A while ago K7A showed a new Brinok model he'd made by kitbashing Zorgs Cardassian models, since K7A is no longer around and the chances of his version being released are slim, I've decided to recreate his work.

This will act as a replacement for your Brinok Class (ccruise1). Because this is a replacement for a stock model I havn't included a new buildbutton or wireframe, however I have replaced the admirals log image.

Included in this mod are:

SOD file
Ship textures
Borg textures
Ship ODF
AdmiralsLog picture

****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Installation Instructions:

1. Place "ccruise1.sod" into the Activision/Star Trek Armada II/SOD folder.
2. Place all files found in the RGB folder into the Activision/Star Trek Armada II/Textures/RGB folder.
3. Place "ccruise1.odf" into the Activision/Star Trek Armada II/odf/ships folder.
4. Place the "ccruise1.bmp" file found in the ShipImages folder into the Activision/Star Trek Armada II/bitmaps/AdmiralsLog/ShipImages folder.

(Ensuring you click "Yes" when the computer asks if you'd like to replace the older files).
