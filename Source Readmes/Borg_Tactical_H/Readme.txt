Class 2 Tactical Cruiser
========================

History
=======
Who said the borg don't produce vessels that are small, agile, and can kick some serious ass. The TTC (Tactical Torpedo Cruiser), or Borg H (as its sometimes known), is a hard hitting, power house. Aside from the usual Borg refinements (transwarp, cutting beams etc.etc), it also carries twin heavy pulse torpedo launchers with which it is quite capable of destroying even the largest of enemy vessels. Also the vessels carries the Tactical Armour which was first encountered by Voyager. This does give the vessel quite an advantage in combat.
