Continuing my line of replacement Cardassian ships I present the new Colony Ship, made by kitbashing Zorgs Galor Class. The model has 4 textures and a poly count of 563.

This will act as a replacement for your Colony Ship (ccolony).

Included in this mod are:

SOD file
Ship textures
Borg textures
Ship ODF
AdmiralsLog picture
Buildbutton
Wireframe

****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Installation Instructions:

1. Place "ccolony.sod" into the Activision/Star Trek Armada II/SOD folder.
2. Place all files found in the RGB folder into the Activision/Star Trek Armada II/Textures/RGB folder.
3. Place "ccolony.odf" into the Activision/Star Trek Armada II/odf/ships folder.
4. Place the "ccolony.bmp" file found in the ShipImages folder into the Activision/Star Trek Armada II/bitmaps/AdmiralsLog/ShipImages folder.

(Ensuring you click "Yes" when the computer asks if you'd like to replace the older files).

5. Find the file named "gui_global.spr" found in the Activision/Star Trek Armada II/Sprites folder and open it (use notepad).

Search for where it says:

"Cardassian Wireframes"

and delete the entry for ccolony

now find where it says:

"@reference=64"

(if "@reference=64" isn't in your Cardassian Wireframes section you'll need to add it at the end of the section).

and add:

ccolonyw1			WFccolony	0	0	64	64
ccolonyw2			WFccolony	0	0	64	64
ccolonyw3			WFccolony	0	0	64	64
ccolonyw4			WFccolony	0	0	64	64
ccolonyw5			WFccolony	0	0	64	64

Save and close the file.
