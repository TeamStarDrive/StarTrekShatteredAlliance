Thank you for downloading the Star Trek Sacrifice of Angels 2 version 0.6R

SoA2 0.6.6R and above will work ONLY on SoaSE: Rebellion version 1.80

SoA 2 is still a work in progress, and probably will always remain a work in progress. Until ether Our interest, or Fan interest in the mod fades away. There are still Models, Weapons, Abilitys, Research, and Factions that need to be added to and/or replaced. Many changes will come as time progresses. 

Do not be lazy.. Read the entire Readme file. There is important information here. We take no responsibility if you damage your Sins installation, or your computer, because you failed to follow the directions provided here. Nor will we, and The Sins Mod Community hold back our sarcasim if you post a question that has already been answered here on this readme. READ IT ALL! Top to bottom.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

IMPORTANT: SoA 2 is an English Language Mod! IF YOUR SINS INSTALLATION IS IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE PLEASE RENAME THE English.str FILE IN THE MODS "String" FOLDER TO YOUR NATIVE LANGUAGE. EXAMPLE: English.str to German.str ETC.

Installation of the Mod:
Tutorial: http://soa2.soase.x90x.net/Install_Rebellion.html

Win 7 / Vista
C:\Users\[username]\Documents\My Games\Ironclad Games\Sins of a Solar Empire Rebellion\...

Win XP
C:\Documents and Settings\[username]\My Documents\My Games\Ironclad Games\Sins of a Solar Empire Rebellion\...

There are 2 different folders for Rebellion mods, the released folder with version, and the developer folder with version.

Regular EXE access --> ...\Mods-Rebellion vX.XX
Developer EXE access --> ...\Mods-Rebellion vX.XX Dev
Sins Mods are very specific to version and expansion type.
vX.XX is the version of Rebellion. There may be multiple folders for different versions of each upgrade. Place the mod in the most current version folder only if the mod was made for that version. Older version folders or the mods in them are no longer used by the game.


NOTE: [username] is your windows account name. Whatever administraitor user name you log into windows as.



Now Basically drag the SoA 2 folder you extracted from the 7z compressed archive into your Mods-Rebellion v1.80 folder.. Thats it.

Go into your Mods-Rebellion 1.80 folder, and double check the SoA 2 installation. Open it up the SoA 2 folder you just put in there. You should see the folders GameInfo, Mesh, Textures, an entity manifest, and so on. If you see just another SoA2 folder then you did it wrong. The correct intallation is ...\Mods-Rebellion v1.80\SoA2

For best results run the mod on a CLEAN install of Sins: Rebellion with NO OTHER MODS ACTIVE. Download the latest version of Sins, via Steam. (Rebellion v1.80 as of this mod version)

The SoA 2 0.6R series, and greater will work ONLY on Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion. Patched to version 1.80. Yes I already stated that above. I am stating it AGAIN to make sure you are reading this. We have had way too many people asking "what version is this mod for?", because they dont bother to read this damn README.

(Thank you Ironclad breaking our mod yet again, and for teaching us patience, and restraint. We just LOVE doing things over, and over, and over again.)
Mods file Naming system, and structure re-organized to mimic Vanilla Sins in order to prevent unecessary, and redundant  Vanilla sins files from loading, and to streamline the mod. Many old, and redundant files were removed. Too much work done to list it all here.

More UI LCAR's work done.
Research trees tweaked. They are still Works in Progress! They will take quite a while to finish.
Models and textures looked over, and fixed where needed. There are still mesh issues (flipped faces, and smoothing issues) from way back. We will get to fixing them eventually, but they are low priority right now.

Research trees are still a WIP. We are not sure how much vanilla sins research is tied into the AI. We need to test the AI to make sure it builds properly.

NOTE: Somewhere along the line in my absense the Mods version numbers got all screwed up. Plus nobody really keeped track on "what" was updated over the last few releases. So i am reverting this back to the 0.5D initial release, and we shall go from there (Major Stress)

Changes from the SoA 2 0.4E/D series to 0.5.1D initial release.

Known Issues: "There will ALWAYS be bugs."

Major Known Issues:

:Weapons will on occasion fire through the firing ships own hulls, and some weapons will fire at wierd, and absurd angles. 

This issue cannot be fixed. The firing arcs of Sins are pretty basic, broad, and they are HARDCODED. The Forward, left, right, and back Firing arcs cover 180 degrees only. There is no way to narrow down, or change the angles which weapons fire. The game will require a complete re-write to change this. Hopefully this will be done in Rebellion. What we have done is reworked the weapons to try to "minimize" instances of weapons firing through their own hulls. There will still be some cases of it happening. Just know it is hardcoded, and that there is nothing we can do about it.

:Cloaking is still a work in progress. 

What we have now is a "functional" cloak, but it still needs more work. It is functional, but not "canon". Due to the nature of Sins itself it will be impossible to make a "canon" cloaking device. To be honest i am amazed we pulled off what we do have. The AI does not use cloak. Nor can we find a way to force it to. The AI is hard coded. For Multiplayer Cloaking can be activated manually (working on "fleet cloak/decloak" abilitys)

:Some Ships, or structures should be "bigger" than what they are in the mod.

This is intentional, but no doubt some one will complain about this. We had to put a size cap on some of the "Super Sized" units (Like the Borg cube). That limit is 1500 meters (on the x axis). Which is still quite large. If we made the ships, and starbases "true scale", then they quite literally would be as large as the planets, and take up half the gravity wells space. To make matters worse the AI pathfinding leaves much to be desired in Sins. So we capped the scale to try, and avoid units playing "bumper cars" with each other. There are enough obstacles in a gravity well as it is. We dont need ships getting stuck to each other on top of this.

:The research trees are still a WIP. 

There are some things people may think are discrepencys, but they are that way for a reason (mainly for balancing purposes). Bringing Trek to Sins was much more difficult than we had originally thought. We had to bend, or break a lot of established "canon" rules just to make things work in the mod. However we try to make things as close to canon as humanly possible without making it look ridiculous. Everyone has their own opinion on what "canon" is, or how things "should" work, or "fit" in the Trek Universe. Enjoy the mod for what it is, and try not to nit pick it to death.

:Sounds on occasion can be VERY loud (especially the Borg Sounds). 

We are working on leveling the loudness on some sounds, and music.

:The new UI is incomplete. 

There are still some "fitting" issues with some of the new UI pictures. For example on some monitors the faction avatars may show like on a filmstrip.

:Some ship meshes are missing faces, and/or have wierd, and very bright lighting on some polys.

This is an issue with ConvertXSI, and XSI itself. The intended modeling program to make meshes for Sins was XSI v6.0. That is also the modeling program ConvertXSI was made to convert meshes from. Problem is that XSI 6.0 does not work with Windows Vista, or 7. ConvertXSI does Work with higher versions of XSI, but does not work very well with them. The meshes will almost ALWAYS have errors. Even the same mesh converted several times will have errors in different spots. So it is a dice roll converting models from versions higher than XSI 6.0. I intended to fix all of the errors, but didnt have the free time to do this.

Playable races in SoA 2 will be the Federation, Romulans, Klingons, Dominion, and The Borg. Other work includes Custom UI, Research trees, and ship/structure meshes. Future versions will address other issues, and add more to the mod.  

FAQs

Will the ships use dynamic or fighter style movement? Yes, all ships will use the fighter style movement except for the larger Borg ships (Cubes).

Will the capital ships have abilities? Yes, right now they each have abilities, but they are all WIP's.

Will the tech trees be changed from the original trees? Yes, this has already been worked on, but is still a WIP.

Will the Pirates, and Planetary Defenders be changed to Trek ships in the future? Yes they will. We are working on TNG era "Ships of the Week" for the Defenders, and Orion Syndicate for the Pirates.

Will Species 8472 be in the mod? Absolutely NOT! 

Note: This mod is about a war between the major ALPHA, BETA, and GAMMA QUADRANT factions. With the Borg being the only faction from the Delta quadrant capable of reaching the Alpha quadrant in a short period of time. 8472, the Kazon, Krenem, Hirogen, etc, etc (ANY faction featured in Voyager, except The Borg) are not capable of reaching the Alpha/beta quadrant. So these factions will NOT be featured. The Borg use a re-constructed Transwap Hub to reach the Alpha Quadrant. The Dominion use the captured Bajor wormhole to summon re-enforcements from the Gamma quadrant. In all honesty the fact is NONE of us on the mod team like Voyager, or Enterprise. So we want to leave out ANY material from Voyager. Except for the Intrepid, and Nova classes.

Will the NX-01 be in the mod? Are you Serious?? This is a Post TNG era mod. While we are using some of the Klingon, Romulan, and Orion ship designs from Enterprise. We will NOT use any Earth ship from Enterprise. You want an Enterprise era mod? Make it yourself.

Will the Prometheus, Wells, or the Scimitar be in the mod?... Sigh, NO! They are considered to be "Uberships". Plus look at which series\movie they came from. We are trying to keep the "absurdity" of Berman/Braga Trek out of this mod.

Just a quick note: 

Technically since the release of JJ Abrams Star Trek. The prime TOS, and TNG timeline doesnt exist anymore. I dont buy the alternate timeline thing. I think JJ trek effectevly wiped out the timeline as we knew it. This mod assumes that the prime universe still exists like JJ trek never happened. Since the initial release of SoA 2 was 1 year before the movie came out. The year is intentionally set at 2388, and YES Romulus, and Vulcan still very much exist. There was no "galactic supernova". Nero is still persuing his life of "honest Labor". Spock is still an ambassador on Romulus. This is a Prime Universe Mod. The events of JJ Trek NEVER happened here.


Can I help out? After this version is released we will be accepting bug fixes only. Community contributions (ships, abilities, etc.) will be accepted after the core work is done (all races in and balanced). Please send them to:

soa2@hotmail.ca

We also have a Wiki Page for the mod:

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Ships in the mod are arranged in the build menus exactly like the ships in Sins are arranged. According to their "roletype". We even added the ships roletype on the ship description to avoid any confusion as to "what does this ship do?". This doesnt mean much for the mod itself. In the mod a ship may, or may not act like the role it was slotted for. In some cases mod ships have "dual roles". We MUST use the Sins roletypes so that the Sins AI will function properly. For example: The Galaxy Class is slotted as an "Elite Carrier". However it does not carry strike craft. Its roletype is a carrier only so the Sins AI will function correctly, and build it. It will act like a pocket battleship in game.

In order for the sins AI to work it MUST see at least one of each vanilla sins roletype in every faction. Every faction MUST have a Scout, Colony frigate, Lrm, siege frigate, etc. etc. If a faction is missing ANY roletype the AI simply will be Slow, and be even more stupid whan what the vanilla AI already is. In many cases the AI will not build anything at all, or expand. In some cases it even crashes the game. In past releases we were missing some roletypes. This has now been remedied.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

A Note on "Elite" units:

They are the same thing as a Sins Capital Ship. However in SoA 2 an "elite" may, or may not be a "true" capital ship. For example the Defiant class is an elite unit, but it is only a small escort cruiser. Not a capital ship

Elite Units are the "hero" units of SoA 2. They stand out over the other typical cannon fodder, and attrition units. They gain levels, and use ability's just like sins capitals do. 

We tried to make it to where there will be no "Free" Elite units in the mod. However the Sins AI needs at least the Colony Capital slot for free, or the AI will not function correctly. You must research elite training, Weapon/armor pre-req's, and the elite units "upgrade" to build all other elite units.
