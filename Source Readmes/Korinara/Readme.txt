Cardassian Korinar Class Warship Ship by Wrath of Achilles

This is my own design, it's meant to be the cardassian equivelent of then
achilles class. it has strong sheilding, normal and multitarget phasers
a standard torpedo launcher and 12 micro torpedo launchers. It's also armed 
with a cloak and the engine boost weapon to aid with hit and run tactics.
It is very expensive, nearlly double a galor class I think. also it's
about 1600 hundred polies, thats ok for an expensive to build ship
but anything built in high numbers may cause trouble for low end machines.
This does not replaces any standard ship but adds it to the second yard.


Installation**

Move all folders (Textures, odf, SOD) to your Star trek armada 2 directory

Open gui_global.SPR and scroll down to the cardassian build buttons.
add this line over the old ccolony button reference.

b_ckorinar			gbbkorinar		0	0	64	64

Then in the wireframe section at the bottom add this line.

ckorinarw1			cardwireframe12		0	0	128	128

Open tech1.TT and add this line over the existing ccolony listing
(for neatness sake you can place with other Cardassian listings)

ckorinar.odf 2 cyard2.odf cresear2.odf 

Open cyard2.odf and scroll down to the build list and add this after buildItem7

buildItem4 = "ckorinar"



Additional Information**

The sod and textures will work in armada 1, file order will have to be changed
for the odfs and they will need editing quite a lot, Email me for help on this
if needed.

Feel free to use this in any mod so long as credit is given to me for the model
and textures, STGamerNew2002 for the button, wireframe and Admiral's log pic. 

Feel free to edit the textures/model/odfs in any way so long as credit is given.
