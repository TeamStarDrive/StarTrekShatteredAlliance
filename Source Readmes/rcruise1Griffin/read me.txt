Griffin class rcruise1 version 2.0 by Aad Moerman

This is a new version of the Romulan Class, with a new mesh and new textures. I've included a new wireframe and
buildbutton.
Also included are a shipfile and 2 weaponfiles. I've given the Griffin more weapons and stronger shields, as the stock ship
is very weak.

Important Note:
Make a backup of your existing files, because the files in this folder will overwrite the stock files!

Credits:

As allways, thanks to Wrath of Achilles for his Texture Tutorial and Major A Payne for his SodTutorial. 

All meshes, textures, etc are by me. 

The Odf files are edited stock files.

Please note:
I cannot be hold responsible for any damage or problems otherwise regarding this model. 


You may use this ship in your mod, just give credit where its do. 


Thank you for downloading.
