I didn't like many of the stock files, and have changed several already. This is the Romulan frigate. 

The ship SOD and ODF file, the ShipImage file and the build-button will replace the stock files, so make a backup, just in case.

As allways, thanks to Wrath of Achilles for his Texture Tutorial and Major A Payne for his SodTutorial.

Enjoy!!
