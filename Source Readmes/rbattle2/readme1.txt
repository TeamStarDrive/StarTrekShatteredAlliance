Hi there,

As with the Kbattle2, I thought, when I saw it the very first time, the Rbattle2 also a ship in need of better looks, so here is my Romulan Venator battleship. As witht the Klingon ships I liked to give this class something extra: the Vulture Class, armed with a heavy Poleron Torpedo. This file contains 2 models, the rbattle2 and Vulture class.

All meshes, textures etc. are by me.
The Poleron Torpedo is an adaptation from the stock Klingon weapon.

Thanks to Wrath of Achilles for his Texture Tutorial and Major A Payne for his SodTutorial
