Continuing my line of replacement Cardassian ships I present the new Rasilak Class, made by kitbashing Zorgs Galor Class. The model has 4 textures and a poly count of 650.

This will act as a replacement for your Rasilak Class (cdestroy). Because this is a replacement for a stock model I havn't included a new buildbutton or wireframe, however I have replaced the admirals log image.

Included in this mod are:

SOD file
Ship textures
Borg textures
Ship ODF
AdmiralsLog picture

****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Installation Instructions:

1. Place "cdestroy.sod" into the Activision/Star Trek Armada II/SOD folder.
2. Place all files found in the RGB folder into the Activision/Star Trek Armada II/Textures/RGB folder.
3. Place "cdestroy.odf" into the Activision/Star Trek Armada II/odf/ships folder.
4. Place the "cdestroy.bmp" file found in the ShipImages folder into the Activision/Star Trek Armada II/bitmaps/AdmiralsLog/ShipImages folder.

(Ensuring you click "Yes" when the computer asks if you'd like to replace the older files).
