This is the edited version of the Prometheus class.

The chrash problem with version 1.0 had to do with the ODF file of the fprom. Now the seperationweapon works fine.

I have added some details in my textures, as it was hard to make out where the torpedolaunchers were placed.
In her normal mode, the ship has 4 tt, all in the gamma section.
In assault mode, the alpha unit activates 2 forward tubes, the same as on the beta unit. All 3 sections in assault mode have now
8 tubes.

KNOWN ISSUE

There could be a problem when using the seperation weapon. The game might chrash. I hope somebody can find what is wrong.
If so, please contact me at: aad.moerman@hetnet.nl

The fusion weapon works fine.

Make a backup of your existing files, just to be on the safe side!

Important Note:

You need to install the Star Trek Armada II Patch Project 1.2.5  first, otherwise the special weapons won't work.

The Fleet Ops Patch Project 1.2.X patch is required for MVAM support.
