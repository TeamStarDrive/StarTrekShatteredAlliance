USS Lethe DRV (Diplomatic/Recon Vessel)
-------------
History
-------
After the success of the Defiant Class it seems that more designs are being created that look very similair. As a result the prototype of this vessel class was put into full production. To date three other vessels of this class are in operation. All but one, though, have the same strengths and weaknessess. The final vessel has been renamed as the USS Incursion, after the original vessel of this name was ambused and destroyed by a Reman taskforce. It is now the only vessel in Starfleet with a "Holo-Generator" as its standard equipment.
