Class 4 Tactical Cube
=====================
Information:

Version 1 of this model was seen only in my BORG: Incursion 2 project and although the mesh was around 80% accurate the armour textures were of low quality. Therefore, version 2 of this model was made as a new scratch built mesh with newer, high detailed textures.

Poly Count: 1220
Build Time: Aprox. 4 hours.
Texture Set: TGA based format. 1024*1024 pixel in 24 bit colour depth. Additional 512*512 	       borg texture used for cube middle.
